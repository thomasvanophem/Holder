The problem
Our shopping website has customers abandoning their purchase in the order form. Our research shows that they drop out because they make typos in their credit card numbers. We can do something about this.

Solution
Implement validation for the credit card number to catch our users mistakes, and provide them helpful feedback.

    - It should tell me the credit card type (Mastercard / Visa / American Express) as soon as it knows it.
    - It should show a green check mark as soon as the valid.
    - If the card type isn't known, show a question mark.
